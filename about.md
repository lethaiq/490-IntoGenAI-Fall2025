## About

Welcome to the Intro to Generative AI and Its Application course. This is a seminar course and is structured with lectures, hands-on coding labs and in-depth discussions.

## Course Description

Generative AI is reshaping how computers create text, images, code, and more. This course introduces the basics of modern generative AI models, including autoencoders, large language models (LLMs), diffusion models. The course introduces key concepts like neural networks, representation learning, transformers, and transfer learning while focusing on applying those concepts to build practical applications using open-source tools and frameworks. Through hands-on projects, you will work with manual and automated prompt engineering, customize llm models, and build applications such as chatbots, RAG systems, speech and image synthesis. The course also discusses important topics like hallucination, security, ethical use, and safeguarding those applications against misuses like deepfakes, bias, and privacy risks.

## Prerequisites
- Comfortable with **Python** and basic data structures
- Prior ML knowledge would be very helpful but not required; a brief **ML refresher** is included in Weeks 2–3

## Required materials
- There is no required textbook; all course reference materials are supplied in-class.
- Generative AI software credit purchases are optional.
- The course will utilize free open-source software, frameworks and free access to commercial generative
AI services including but not limited to ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude.
- Students are expected to supply a personal working laptop computer of sufficient memory and storage with permissions to install and use course software.

## Grading & Assessments
Gradings of all assignments, quizzes, attendance and other assessments will be updated on Canvas. The course will include the following components with respective weights:

| Component | Weight | Description |
|---|---:|---|
| Participation & Attendance | **20%** | In‑class attendance and engagement |
| Labs & Coding Assignments | **15%** | coding with write‑ups and analysis |
| Reading Quizzes | **5%** | Short 5-min reading quizzes |
| Paper Presentations | **10%** | Group presentations |
| Midterm Project (Individual) | **25%** | Working demo + report + video + in‑class presentation |
| Final Project (Team) | **25%** | Working demo + report + video |


*grading assessments are subject to change

## Attendance
Regular attendance and active participation are expected. If you are unable to attend, email the instructor in advance.

## Electronics
Laptops/phones are allowed for course work only; avoid distracting others.

## Late Policy
- Late submissions accepted up to **1 week** for at most **70%** credit maximum.
- Contact instructor proactively for emergencies.

## Communication
Check your email and this course website regularly for updates.

## Accommodations
Students needing accommodations should contact the instructor as early as possible.

## Academic Integrity
Use of generative AI must follow assignment instructions. Disallowed use (e.g., submitting AI‑written code as your own when not permitted) is an integrity violation. IU's acdemic integrity is applied.
